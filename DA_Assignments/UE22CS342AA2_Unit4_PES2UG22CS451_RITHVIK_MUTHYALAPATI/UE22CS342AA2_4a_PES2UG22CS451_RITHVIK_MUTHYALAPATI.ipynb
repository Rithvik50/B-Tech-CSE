I wouldn't say that these are over the top, but I do believe they are decent. The actual bombs are small, fitting in the palm of your hand. The scents are a bit strong, more perfume scented than fruit scented. The orange actually smells like orange, but the others smell like perfume. A little too strong. The bombs do float and fizz longer than the other brands I have tried out. The water is colored with pretty colors and not just a dirty looking bath.

For $14 at the time of review, you get 30 rolls of gauze. These are literally the perfect size for any first aid kit or jump bag. The one thing I like most is that the gauze doesn't stick to wounds nor fall apart. They are multi-ply gauze that are well thread. You can pull this tot without worrying about it ripping. It could be a makeshift sling if needed it's that durable. I find the individual wrapped rolls better to use than a large roll where you have to keep cutting after each use. These are perfect \"one time use\" rolls. They fit snug in the box or you can stick them all in your kit depending on size.

The orange actually smells like orange, but the others smell like perfume. A little too strong. The bombs do float and fizz longer than the other brands I have tried out. The water is colored with pretty colors and not just a dirty looking bath. I would say these are better for kids than adults personally, but for the price, you can't go wrong. I don't care for the perfume scents, but some do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "6 I've been putting together my jump bag which requires a lot of gauze and bandages. For $14 at the time of review, you get 30 rolls of gauze. These are literally the perfect size for any first aid kit or jump bag. The one thing I like most is that the gauze doesn't stick to wounds nor fall apart. They are multi-ply gauze that are well thread. You can pull this tot without worrying about it ripping. It could be a makeshift sling if needed it's that durable. I find the individual wrapped rolls better to use than a large roll where you have to keep cutting after each use. These are perfect \"one time use\" rolls. They fit snug in the box or you can stick them all in your kit depending on size. No complaints here!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
